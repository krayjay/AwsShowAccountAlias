# ViolentMonkey AwsShowAccountAlias Script
This is a Violentmonkey script (Browser Extension) that will show your AWS Account ID Number and your Account Alias inside of the AWS Console where your login name is. For some reason AWS likes to hide this from view and this is a vast improvement over it's current form, I suspect they will add it in the future.

# Guide
1. Install ViolentMonkey browser extension (tested in Chrome)
2. Add new script to extension with the code in this repository and you're done
3. Navigate to your AWS console and look at to the top right of your browser. It will be in orange text.
